<purpose>
Provide a beginner-friendly guided tour of the core GPD command surface for
new users. Teach what the main commands do and when to use them, and make clear
that the tour does not create project artifacts, create files, or route into
other workflows.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before
starting.
</required_reading>

<process>

<step name="orient_the_user">
Open with one short sentence:

`This is a guided tour of the main GPD commands. It does not change your files.`

Then explain that GPD has two broad entry modes:

- `start` for choosing the right first action in a folder
- direct commands for when the user already knows what they want
</step>

<step name="explain_the_core_paths">
Use a compact, beginner-facing table or bullet list with these entries:

- `/gpd:start` - Use when you are not sure what this folder should do yet
- `/gpd:new-project --minimal` - Use for the fastest start on brand-new work
- `/gpd:new-project` - Use when you want the full guided setup
- `/gpd:map-research` - Use when you already have papers, notes, or code and want GPD to map them first
- `/gpd:resume-work` - Use when an existing GPD project is already set up and you want to continue
- `/gpd:progress` - Use when you want a broader status snapshot
- `/gpd:suggest-next` - Use when you want the next best action after resuming
- `/gpd:explain <topic>` - Use when you want a concept explained in plain language
- `/gpd:quick` - Use for a small bounded task
- `/gpd:help` - Use when you want the command reference

For each entry, include one plain-English sentence about when it is the right
choice and one sentence about when it is not the right choice.
</step>

<step name="show_simple_decision_rules">
Summarize the decision tree in plain language:

- If the folder is empty or new, start with `/gpd:start` or `/gpd:new-project --minimal`
- If the folder already contains research material, use `/gpd:map-research`
- If the folder already has GPD state, use `/gpd:resume-work`
- If the user only wants a concept explained, use `/gpd:explain <topic>`
- If the user only wants the next step, use `/gpd:suggest-next`

Keep this section short and explicitly note that `tour` does not execute those
commands.
</step>

<step name="highlight_common_mistakes">
Call out the beginner traps to avoid:

- Do not use `new-project` if you only want to look around
- Do not use `resume-work` unless the project already has GPD state
- Do not use `map-research` for a truly empty folder
- Do not treat `help` as a setup wizard; it is the reference surface

Keep the tone explanatory, not corrective.
</step>

<step name="close_with_next_steps">
End with a short wrap-up that says:

- `If you are still unsure, run /gpd:start.`
- `If you want the reference list again later, run /gpd:help.`
- `If you want to practice on your current folder, choose one of the commands above based on the state of the folder.`

Do not ask the user to pick a branch and do not continue into another workflow.
</step>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] The user sees that `tour` is read-only and non-destructive
- [ ] The core GPD entry points are explained in beginner language
- [ ] The difference between `start`, `new-project`, `map-research`, and `resume-work` is clear
- [ ] The response does not silently route into another workflow
- [ ] The response ends with simple next-step guidance
